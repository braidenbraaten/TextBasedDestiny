# TextBasedDestiny
this is Destiny, but text based.
Hello everyone, if you made it this far, Great! Although this is one of the many games that I will work on 
for the next couple of years, I am hoping this can be one that I will work on for years to come, and try to recreate 
the Amazing Destiny we know into a textadventure! Like i have said on some of my posts, I would love to have others who share
a passion in programming join in on making this become a full game. Or even if you want to spectate and play the game as development
progresses, As I am trying to put myself out there in the industry for the game world, this game is what I hope to help 
me make that first step. I am greatful for you guys to even take the time to be here, Thank you and have fun Guardians!
